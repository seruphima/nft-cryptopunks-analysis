# [NFT Value and Rarity](https://nft-cryptopunks-analysis.herokuapp.com/) 
NFT price prediction using Machine Learning

> NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) have dramatically increased in value with the recent upsurge in popularity of cryptocurrencies. NFT project was launched in 2017 by Larva Labs Studio and is traded on the Ethereum blockchain. The relationship between a specific NFT and its value is neither straightforwards nor intuitive and is thought by many to be due to the rarity of a specific NFT's attributes. Investors seeking to enter the nascent NFT market need to understand the predictive value that attributes may have on NFT price to improve returns on investment.

> This project highlights the complex nature between NFT value and the rarity of NFT attributes. Findings are presented on the key trends and variables such as NFT type and accessories that drive NFT value. NFT value is shown as current price compared to the moving average of recent NFT sales in both Ethereum and US Dollar denominations. Ethereum value is calculated by the daily closing price in US Dollars.
